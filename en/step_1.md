![Illustration of a computer screen and a phone screen, both displaying a web page.](images/html_and_css_placeholder.png)

The Raspberry Pi Editor can be used to write and run code in a web browser without installing any additional software and without the need to create an account (although if youâ€™re logged in to a Raspberry Pi Foundation account, your coding project is automatically saved).

<div>

 The <span style="color: #0faeb0"><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/microbit-intro">Introduction to web path</a></span> will help you take your first steps with HTML and CSS. Along the way you will create fun projects and become a web creator!
